# AI-Power-Stations
Algorithm with the goal of optimize the benefit of power stations by assigning the most optimal clients.
The approximation used is based on [Local Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(optimization)).

This code generates an environment where several strategies can be tested as [Hill Climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing)
or [Simulated Annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).

In addition, customized strategies can be implemented as closing power stations if they don't have enough clients to generate a viable margin.
